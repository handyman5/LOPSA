*/Marketing* 
This directory will contain projects related to LOPSA marketing efforts. Flyer, ads, and so on can be placed in here. Please create subdirectories as needed, one per marketing effort. In other words, a generic "Chapter Sponsor Flyer" would go in one directory, but a series of ads all targeted at a particular promotion or conference would probably belong together. 

*/New Chapter Packet*
This project holds the guide for starting a new chapter, as well as sample chapter by-laws (in addition to any other new-chapter-specific files that will be created in the future. 

*/Proposed Policies*
As members create and suggest policies, they should be created under the username of the primary sponsor of the policy. Multiple people can work together, of course, but there should be a single person to lead the movement for that particular action.
