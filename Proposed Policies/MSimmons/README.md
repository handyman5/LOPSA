==Policies proposed by Matt Simmons==

**Harassment Policy** (initiated 2012-05)

This policy came as a direct result of my participation and moderation of the [May 24th LOPSA Live Session](https://lopsa.org/content/lopsa-live-may-24-2012-candidate-forum-transcript), where it was brought to my attention that LOPSA doesn't have this policy, and that a number of members feel strongly that there should be one in place.
